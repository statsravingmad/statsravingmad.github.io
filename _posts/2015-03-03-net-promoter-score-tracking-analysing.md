# What is a Net Promoter Score

  "Net Promoter Score" is a customer loyalty metric developed by (and a registered trademark of) Fred Reichheld, Bain & Company, and Satmetrix. It was introduced by Reichheld in his 2003 Harvard Business Review article "One Number You Need to Grow". NPS can be as low as âˆ’100 (everybody is a detractor) or as high as +100 (everybody is a promoter). An NPS that is positive (i.e., higher than zero) is felt to be good, and an NPS of +50 is excellent.

  Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer. The provider can be a company, employer or any other entity. The provider is the entity that is asking the questions on the NPS survey. The consumer is the customer, employee, or respondent to an NPS survey.

# An Example

An e-commerce company is running a survey on employees to identify their level of satisfaction plus the possibility of using the referrals as a source of new recruitement.

All employees that belong to the company for more than 6 months are eligible for the survey. In turn, 350 employees submitted their Recommender Score.
