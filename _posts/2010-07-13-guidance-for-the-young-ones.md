I was flicking thru some papers I have printed in the last years and definetely Breiman&#8217;s is one of my favorite. A pragmatic and insightful reading for a new statistician (or data analyst if you prefer;)).

> As I left consulting to go back to the university,these were the perceptions I had about working with data to ﬁnd answers to problems:

> (a) Focus on ﬁnding a good solution—that’s what consultants get paid for.  
> (b) **Live with the data** before you plunge into modeling.  
> (c) Search for a model that gives a **good solution**, either **algorithmic** or **data**.  
> (d) **Predictive accuracy** on test sets is the criterion for how good the model is.  
> (e) Computers are an indispensable partner.
