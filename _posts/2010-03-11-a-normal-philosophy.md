The following was sent by email to me. It originates to [Youden][1].

<pre>THE
                                NORMAL
                             LAW OF ERROR
                           STANDS OUT IN THE
                         EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND
                        AS ONE OF  THE BROADEST
                       GENERALIZATIONS OF NATURAL
                     PHILOSOPHY . IT SERVES AS THE
                   GUIDING INSTRUMENT IN RESEARCHES
                IN THE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AND
               IN MEDICINE AGRICULTURE AND ENGINEERING .
          IT IS AN INDISPENSABLE TOOL FOR THE ANALYSIS AND THE
INTERPRETATION OF THE BASIC DATA OBTAINED BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT</pre>

Youden is one of the truly inspiring statisticians to me.
