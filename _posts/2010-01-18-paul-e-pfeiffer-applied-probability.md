I must admit that I have a pretty complete electronic library from the giant publishing acts. Yet, from time to time, course notes are better to skim through as they tenf to get more practical (or cookbok if you want to!). The trend nowasays is to supplement everything with code or software packages. this is definetely a good thing with the exception that decent treory books of intermediate level are to cast to the ends of earth.

A good book on (applied) probability got into my mailbox. It&#8217;s Paul E Pfeiffer&#8217;s Applied Probability book spice up with Matlab code. I would definetely recommend this to intermediate students.
