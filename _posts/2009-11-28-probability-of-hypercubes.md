&#8230;in R of course!

There is a handy function to do those calculations. Normally (ahh!) you might resolve to a symbolic calculation package (Maple,Mathematica etc.)Â  but that is not the situation any more. The calculations are done with the [mnormt][1] package. Relevant functions exist in other packages as well ([R : Distributions][2])
