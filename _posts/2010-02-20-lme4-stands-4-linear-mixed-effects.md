There is a certain hype about mixed (and random) effects among statistician and analysts. You can show some love to Douglas Bates and Martin Maechler for maintaing the lme4 package for our cupid, R <img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.statsravingmad.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?w=768" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />

I copy the entity of the information of the projects [page][1].

> **Doxygen** documentation of the underlying C functions is [**here**][2].
> 
> The **project summary page** you can find [**here**][3].
> 
> **References to articles and other research using nlme or lme4** can be found [**here**][4]. The LaTeX bibliography file can be accessed from [here][5]. If you would like to add your work to this database, please email vasishth.shravan at gmail dot com
> 
> **Slides** from short courses on lme4 are [**here**][6].
> 
> **Chapter drafts** of the book *lme4: Mixed-effects Modeling with R* are available [**here**][7].

To complete this quick post, I append the following vignettes.
