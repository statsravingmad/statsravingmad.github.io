I found time and read Gelman and Hill&#8217;s &#8220;[Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel / Hierarchical Models][1]&#8220;&#8230;Now, please do yourself a favour and get it (of course the paperback version ;)). Even for experienced or intermediate (myself) this will be a treat for your eyes and neurons.

##### PS : (Confession) I didn&#8217;t like the Bayesian Data Analysis book.
