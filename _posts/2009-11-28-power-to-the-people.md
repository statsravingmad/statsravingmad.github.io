[Statistica Sinica][1] loves us! Well, not truly but it&#8217;s OK&#8230;

I found out earlier tonight that a year&#8217;s old issues are [freely available][2] from their website! And that&#8217;s a good thing, tight? Moreover, [preprints ][3]sit there waiting for us to right click and save them to our disks!

I really like the following article,

Zhang, Shaojun; Niu, Xu-Feng; Ang, James S., *Building tracking portfolios based on a Generalized Information Criterion*, Statist.Sinica 13, No. 4, 1075-1096 , 2003. [[link][4]]
