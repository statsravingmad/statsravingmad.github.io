Well, I&#8217;m writing this from my new system. After years on hiatus I migrated to Linux, once again. Setting up a full system on Linux for a Greek user had been one of the greatest challenges.

First,of all setting up writing, reading & printing in Greek was the biggest obstacle, I still recall memories of 2000/2001 when installing the 9th (?) edition of Mandrake Linux, supposed to have full Greek language integration. As if? Second, comes networking with Linux. Win-modems ruled Greek market and made it really painful to read all these articles to even start hoping that you might be near configuring your Internet connection.

Yet, I used Linux till 2003 or 2004 with no Internet connection and used my Windows to surf the net&#8230; Courageous, right? Last night I was surfing for open source ideas and stumbled upon [Wuby][1]. Wubi is a windows-ish application for [Ubuntu][2], the hottest for users of my clan! I installed on my disk, chose my graphical environment ([Gnome][3], no regrets) and one thing left to check&#8230;the Internet highway.

Turns out that, routers (those using Ethernet ports!) are plug & go. Neat! Unfortunatelly, I&#8217;m stuck with my USB model my provider gave a couple of  years ago ;( Sad thoughts paid a short visit I must admit. But, even this  was no real problem, UbuDSL has everything under control :thumps up:

Of, course I installed [RKWard][4], there&#8217;s a Windows version, too. I never got to make it work, though&#8230;
