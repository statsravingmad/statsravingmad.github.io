Jobless as I might be, I do have some clients for data analysis. I try not to visit them in their office coz then things get really slow and time-consuming. When I can&#8217;t escape this, the worst thing is tuning data and software with client. So, I have a USB with portable versions of my toolbox. Yesterday, I installed R and today I tested it. It worked fine!

If you want to try it, download the software platform from [here][1]. Install it (when prompt to extract/unzip) into a file in your USB, ie /OS, and then download the R portable from [here][2]. From the portable OS menu (down-right on your screen) select install software and browse to the R portable file. After a couple of minutes you&#8217;re done!
