> <span>After stunning American audiences with his powerful solo performances, Villagers’ frontman Conor J. O’Brien has confirmed his first ever full band North American tour supporting the Mercury Prize-nominated debut, ‘Becoming a Jackal’ (Domino Records). In addition to several headlining dates, the group has confirmed supporting dates with Ra Ra Riot and Givers.</span>

The track is pretty good on average…
