It’s the second time I quote Donald Rumsfeld over my Facebook status. This time I used the *known-unknown* fan fair…

> *“As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns &#8211; the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”*

##### *Who.is*

##### *A recent fact*

I copy from <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/author/Amanda" target="_blank">Amanda Terkel</a>’s article of the 28th of last month:

> Donald Rumsfeld was back at the Pentagon for the unveiling of his official portrait in a ceremony hosted by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The painting <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=59795" target="_blank">shows Rumsfeld at his stand-up desk</a> with a picture of first-responders and soldiers unfurling the flag over the still-burning Pentagon on Sept. 12, 2001.β€ It will hang in the Pentagon along with his other portrait, commemorating when he served as defense secretary from 1975 to 1977. As the Washington Post reported in 2008, this new portrait of Rumsfeld <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/20/AR2008102003627.html" target="_blank">cost nearly $50,000</a>.
