So many times you&#8217;ve in a situation where Excel is your god-sent tool. Yeap, I&#8217;m talking about statistics & excel, the 8th sin! I found myself tutoring a couple of days ago and I found myself stuck with Excel. How to perform a stepwise procedure overcoming the burden of VB (which I know nothing about it) or defining cell functions?

There is an add-in that comes handy I must admit, [Stepwise Regression Add-In][1]. There is one or two problems when installing and I had a problem with variables names (I solved it using the usual notation x1,x2,&#8230;,xn,y I suggest you do the same) but it&#8217;s overall good. When in a situation as mine , use it!
