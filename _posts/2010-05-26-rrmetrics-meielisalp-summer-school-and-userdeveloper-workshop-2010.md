\*\\*\* Rmetrics 2010 &#8211; Don&#8217;t miss it ! \*\**

The Summer School and User/Developer Meeting focus on topics from &#8220;Computational Finance and Financial Engineering&#8221; and on the use of R/Rmetrics in finance, insurance and related fields.

The Summer School morning sessions have four tutorials given by key note speakers covering topics from time series analysis, stochastic differential equations, and risk management. The tutorials are together with practical exercises.

**Summer School Lecturers:**  
* Alexander McNeil, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK  
<span style="color: #00ff00;">Copulas with Examples in R</span>  
* Eckhard Platen, University of Technology Sydney, Australia  
<span style="color: #00ff00;">A Benchmark Approach to Computative Finance</span>  
* Nakahiro Yoshida, Math Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan

* Eric Zivot, Economics Department, University Washington, Seattle, USA  
<span style="color: #00ff00;">Analysis of High Frequency Data in R</span>

The afternoon User/Developer Meetings are dedicated to contributed talks and presentations reflecting the wide range of fields in which R and Rmetrics are used in finance and insurance to analyze and model data. The goal is to bring together students, researchers, developers, practitioners, and users from finance and insurance providing a platform for common discussions and exchange of ideas.
