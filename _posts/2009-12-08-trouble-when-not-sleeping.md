Well, that&#8217;s not that encouraging since I tend to sleep on the early hours&#8230;

  * Short sleep duration ( <5 or 5-6 hours ) increased risk for high BP by  350% to 500% compared to those who slept longer than 6 hours per night.  As you know, high BP kills.

  * Young people ( 25-49 years of age ) are twice as likely to get high BP  if they sleep less. Individuals who slept less than 5 hours a night had a 3-fold increased  risk of heart attacks.  Complete and partial lack of sleep increased the blood concentrations of High sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-cRP), the strongest predictor of  heart attacks. Even after getting adequate sleep later, the levels stayed  high!!
  * Sleeping for <=5 hours per night leads to 39% increase in heart disease.
  * Just one night of sleep loss increases very toxic substances in body such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumour Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-alpha) and C-reactive protein (cRP). They increase risks of many medical conditions,  including cancer, arthritis and heart disease.
  * Sleeping for <=6 hours per night leads to 8% increase in heart disease.

Houston we are about to get a problem!:)
