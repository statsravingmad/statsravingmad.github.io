Didn&#8217;t know this&#8230;

<pre>a&lt;-structure(c(25,34,12,5),.Names=c("0","2","4","7+"))
&gt; data
 0  2  4 7+
25 34 12  5
</pre>

It&#8217;s becoming clear that I have learned R in the most unstructured way&#8230;I always do it in two stages :ashamed:

<pre>&gt; data&lt;-c(25,34,12,5)
&gt; names(data)&lt;-c("0","2","4","7+")
&gt; data
 0  2  4 7+
25 34 12  5</pre>

It&#8217;s really useful to wrap it all in a single function.

<pre>Attribute Specification

Description:

 ‘structure’ returns the given object with further attributes
 set.

Usage:

 structure(.Data, ...)

Arguments:

 .Data: an object which will have various attributes attached to it.

 ...: attributes, specified in ‘tag=value’ form, which will be
 attached to data.

Details:

 Adding a class ‘"factor"’ will ensure that numeric codes are
 given integer storage mode.

 For historical reasons (these names are used when deparsing),
 attributes ‘".Dim"’, ‘".Dimnames"’, ‘".Names"’,
 ‘".Tsp"’ and ‘".Label"’ are renamed to ‘"dim"’,
 ‘"dimnames"’, ‘"names"’, ‘"tsp"’ and ‘"levels"’.

 It is possible to give the same tag more than once, in which case
 the last value assigned wins.  As with other ways of assigning
 attributes, using ‘tag=NULL’ removes attribute ‘tag’ from
 ‘.Data’ if it is present.
